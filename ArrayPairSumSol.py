# Array Pair Sum: Given an integer array, output all the unique pairs 
# that sum up to a specific value k.

# Author: Pradeep K. Pant, ppant@cpan.org

# The O(N) algorithm uses the set data structure. We perform a linear pass 
# from the beginning and for each element we check whether k-element is in the 
# set of seen numbers. If it is, then we found a pair of sum k and add it to 
# the output. If not, this element doesnâ€™t belong to a pair yet, and we add it 
# to the set of seen elements. The algorithm is really simple once we figure 
# out using a set. The complexity is O(N) because we do a single linear scan of 
# the array, and for each element we just check whether the corresponding number 
# to form a pair is in the set or add the current element to the set. 
# Insert and find operations of a set are both average O(1), so the algorithm 
# is O(N) in total.
