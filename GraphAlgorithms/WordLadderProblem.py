# let’s consider the following puzzle called a word ladder. Transform the 
# word “FOOL” into the word “SAGE”. In a word ladder puzzle you must make 
# the change occur gradually by changing one letter at a time. At each step 
# you must transform one word into another word, you are not allowed to 
# transform a word into a non-word. 
# The following sequence of words shows one possible solution to the problem posed above.
#FOOL
#POOL
#POLL
#POLE
#PALE
#SALE
#SAGE
# There are many variations of the word ladder puzzle. For example you might 
# be given a particular number of steps in which to accomplish the transformation, 
# or you might need to use a particular word. In this section we are interested in 
# figuring out the smallest number of transformations needed to turn the starting word 
# into the ending word.
