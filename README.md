# Data Structures and Algorithms using Python
This is a collection of various common programming problems solved using Data structures implemented in Python. I have mostly done this before in C/C++/Perl. This is a attempt to solve using Python. Please feel free to collaborate.

## Anagram algorithm ##	
Algorithm will take two strings and check to see if they are anagrams. An anagram is when the two strings can be written using the exact same letters in other words rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once	
```	Some examples of anagram:
	"dormitory" is an anagram of "dirty room"
	"a perfectionist" is an anagram of "I often practice."
	"action man" is an anagram of "cannot aim" 
```	
Our anagram check algorithm with take two strings and will give a boolean TRUE/FALSE depends on anagram found or not?

## Array Pair Sum ##	
Given an integer array, output all the unique pairs that sum up to a specific value k.
So the input:
```	sum_arr_uniq_pairs([1,2,2,3,4,1,1,3,2,1,3,1,2,2,4,0],5)
	would return 2 pairs:

 	(2,3)
 	(1,4)
 ```
