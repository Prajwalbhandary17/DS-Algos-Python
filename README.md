# DS-Algos-Python
Coding solutions to various DS and alogs using Python. I will try to provide solutions for some of the common DS problems using Python.


## Anagram algorithm ##
	```
	Algorithm will take two strings and check to see if they are anagrams. An anagram is when the two strings can be written using the exact same letters in other words rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once
	
	Some examples of anagram:
	"dormitory" is an anagram of "dirty room"
	"a perfectionist" is an anagram of "I often practice."
	"action man" is an anagram of "cannot aim"
	
	Our anagram check algorithm with take two strings and will give a boolean TRUE/FALSE depends on anagram found or not?
	```

## Array Pair Sum ##	
Given an integer array, output all the unique pairs that sum up to a specific value k.
```
So the input:

pair_sum([1,3,2,2],4)

would return 2 pairs:

 (1,3)
 (2,2)
 ```
